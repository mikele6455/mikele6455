Hello! My name is Michael and I'm currently (2021) a sophomore at Lewis-Clark State University!
I joined the Computer Science program completely blind starting college, but suprisingly I've developed a passion for the major!.
Currently, I am learning C++ and Linux all while trying to hone my Python skills.
The project I am working on at the time of writing this is a small scale Jeopardy game using C++.
I appreciate your time looking through my projects!

If you have met me personally and are looking to ask some questions, please use my email address, otherwise please open an issue.
