Hello! My name is Michael and I'm currently (2021) a sophomore at Lewis-Clark State University!
I joined the Computer Science program completely blind starting college, but suprisingly I've developed a passion for the major!.
Currently, I am learning C++ and Linux all while trying to hone my Python skills.

If you have met me personally and are looking to ask some questions, please use my email address, otherwise please open an issue.
